      A major way of displaying authors and affiliations information is to use
      superscripts on the authors and affiliations. It should be mentioned that
      the affiliations for the superscriptaddress are presented and numbered in
      the order that they are encountered.
  - id: groupedaddress
    type: boolean
    required: false
    default: true
    description: >-
      To group authors with the same affiliation together this option can be
      chosen. This is the default behavior for most journals.
  - id: unsortedaddress
    type: boolean
    required: false
    default: false
    description: Does not sort authors into specific groups.
  - id: runinaddress
    type: boolean
    required: false
    default: false
    description: >-
      Like groupedaddress, but joins multiple affiliations together into a
      single sequence separated by commas.
  - id: frontmatterverbose
    type: boolean
    required: false
    default: false
    description: More verbose display of authors and affiliations.

    description: >-
      The footnote text can either appear at the bottom of a page or as part of
      the bibliography. This option results it in only showing up in the
      bibliography.
  - id: bibnotes
    type: boolean
    required: false
    description: >-
      Specifies whether additional author information such as email or homepage
      are put on the first page or at the st of the bibliography. For instance,
      the prb option puts all such footnotes at the start of the bibliography
      while the prl journal styles displays them on the first page. One can
      override a journal style’s default behavior by specifying explicitly the
      class option bibnotes (puts the footnotes at the start of the
      bibliography) or nobibnotes (puts them on the first page).
